# Notes:

-   Creating react and typescript from scratch based off of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elpu7CIuqjY
-   Babel is used to convert the typescript into javascript that can be understood by the browser
-   Webpack is used to compile the files and make them work for their respective environments
-   Husky and lint-staged is being used to make sure that linting and formatting errors are not committed
-   Bundle Analyzer Plugin helps you understand what the bundle size looks like
-   Turn on analyzerMode in webpack.prod.js to see what the bundle sizes look like visually. Don't ship with this change.
